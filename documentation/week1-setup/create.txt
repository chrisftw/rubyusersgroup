BUILDING THE PROJECT:
You have a couple choices when building the project.

  1. You can fork and clone the project from GitHub which is suggested
     for a good starting point and the most recent state of the project.
     To learn how to fork and clone a GitHub project see:
     https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo
   
  2. You can create the project by hand:

     #create a new project without a default testing framework
     rails new rubyusergrouporg -T

     #cd into new project directory
     cd rubyusergrouporg

     #install rspec using current environment (bundle exec)
     bundle exec rails g rspec:install

     #update Gemfile to include rspec-rails and capybara

       group :test, :development do
         gem 'rspec-rails'
         gem 'capybara'
       end

     #build scaffolding for the new application
     rails generate scaffold user name email hashed_password
     rails generate scaffold group name profile:text established_on
     rails generate scaffold membership user_id group_id

     #delete Rails index page
     rm public/index.html 

     #set default route
     root :to => '/#index'

     #create the database from scaffold
     rake db:migrate
